 ## Design

### Imagery

The imagery used on this website are purposly choosen to bring the user to stay motivated while scrolling through the website. It improves the overall experience. We are aware of the fact that most users are on the website because they or their love ones are having health issues. Therefor we provide a good contrast so the users can properly navigate and find the right informatiions in short time. 

### Colours

The color scheme of the website is white, light-green and light-blue providing a good background to the dark grey font used. 

### Fonts

lato font is the main font used throughout the whole website. This font was imported via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) . I'm using Sans Serif as a backup font, in case for any reason the main font isn't being imported into the site correctly.
